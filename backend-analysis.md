## Backend Analysis

Based on the examination of the backend directory, here's what I understand:

1. **Technology Stack**:
   - The backend is built using FastAPI (v0.115.11), a modern Python web framework
   - Uses Uvicorn (v0.34.0) as the ASGI server
   - Includes Mangum (v0.19.0) for AWS Lambda compatibility
   - Uses Pydantic (v2.10.6) for data validation
   - Development dependencies include Black for code formatting

2. **API Structure**:
   - Has a main.py file that serves as the entry point
   - Contains at least two endpoints:
     - Root endpoint (`/`)
     - Restaurant listing endpoint (`/restaurants`)
   - Uses async endpoints, suggesting non-blocking I/O operations

3. **Project Setup**:
   - Has proper Python project structure with requirements.txt
   - Includes standard Python gitignore patterns for:
     - Virtual environments (venv, ENV)
     - Cache files (__pycache__, .pyc)
     - Build artifacts and distributions
     - Environment files (.env)
     - Test coverage and cache files
   - Development environment can be set up using the dependencies listed in requirements.txt

This appears to be a REST API service, likely serving as the backend for a restaurant-related application. The use of FastAPI suggests a focus on performance and modern Python async capabilities, while the inclusion of Mangum indicates it's designed to be deployable on AWS Lambda.

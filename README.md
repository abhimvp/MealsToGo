# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Overview of what is what

- `app.json` - this is where we control, sort of what we would call the metadata of the application , like it controls the name of the app when it goes to play store, icon you see when you install the application on your phone ..etc.

## Played around on how stack & Tab Navigation can be done using expo.

- Now i got it - i was confused at the start but now i feel better when i did it step by step ,took time but never mind initial understanding of how things working helps, now i can just go ahead and build the app, documentation is great. went through https://docs.expo.dev/develop/file-based-routing/ & https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/tabs/
- When the app loads , it shows the index.tsx file present in (home) & remaining as usual.For this commit & test code - i will upload pictures for my assets/images/reference to get back to this later on what is displayed for what code i have tried.

<img src="assets/images/When app loads Home Tab index tsx.jpg" width="150" /> <img src="assets/images/Home details Stack.jpg" width="150" /> <img src="assets/images/User Tab.jpg" width="150" /> <img src="assets/images/USer details Stack.jpg" width="150" /> <img src="assets/images/Settings Tab.jpg" width="150" /> <img src="assets/images/Test Tab.jpg" width="150" />

- ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
  - ESLint is completely pluggable. Every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime. You can also add community plugins, configurations, and parsers to extend the functionality of ESLint.
  - https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/eslint-config-react-native
  - `yarn add --dev eslint prettier @react-native/eslint-config`
  - created file `.eslintrc` and telling eslint you're going to use React Native Community Configuration.
  - In `package.json` - "lint": "eslint . --ext .js" in scripts - calling eslint package and saying (.) means check whole directory but only for the `js` files.
  - - `yarn add react-native-paper` - for fun

âœ– 33 problems (33 errors, 0 warnings)

```

- Fix was for me to add `import React from 'react';` in the following error files .. silly
- After Fix looks like :

```jsx
$ yarn lint
yarn run v1.22.22
$ eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx
Warning: React version not specified in eslint-plugin-react settings. See https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react#configuration .
Done in 4.15s.
```

## General Idea

- **app directory**

TheÂ **app**Â is a special directory. Any file you add to this directory becomes a route inside the native app and reflects the same URL for that route on the web.

- **Root layout**

Traditionally, React Native projects are structured with a single root component (defined asÂ **App.js**Â orÂ **index.js**). Similarly, the first layout file (**\_layout.tsx**) inside theÂ **app**Â directory is considered to be the single root component.

- **Create a route**

In theÂ **app**Â directory, a route is created by adding a file or a nested directory that includesÂ **index.tsx**Â file.

For example, to create an initial route of your app, you can addÂ **index.tsx**Â to theÂ **app**Â directory.

- styled-components can be used with React Native in the same way and with the same import.https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native - styleSheets are great , but we want more consistency - there's something called DesignOps - when you're building a product , taking into account all of the constraints and making sure that the constraints are fit,picture perfect along the way - a design system - a theme - which gives us consistency `styled-components is the result of wondering how we could enhance CSS for styling React component systems. By focusing on a single use case we managed to optimize the experience for developers as well as the output for end users.` - so we will move away from StyleSheet syntax and create components having their styling already on it. For example : Also DO `yarn add styled-components`

```tsx
import React from "react";
import styled from "styled-components/native";

const StyledView = styled.View`
  background-color: papayawhip;
`;

const StyledText = styled.Text`
  color: #bf4f74;
`;

class MyReactNativeComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <StyledView>
        <StyledText>Hello World!</StyledText>
      </StyledView>
    );
  }
}
```

# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Overview of what is what

- `app.json` - this is where we control, sort of what we would call the metadata of the application , like it controls the name of the app when it goes to play store, icon you see when you install the application on your phone ..etc.

## Played around on how stack & Tab Navigation can be done using expo.

- Now i got it - i was confused at the start but now i feel better when i did it step by step ,took time but never mind initial understanding of how things working helps, now i can just go ahead and build the app, documentation is great. went through https://docs.expo.dev/develop/file-based-routing/ & https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/tabs/
- When the app loads , it shows the index.tsx file present in (home) & remaining as usual.For this commit & test code - i will upload pictures for my assets/images/reference to get back to this later on what is displayed for what code i have tried.
